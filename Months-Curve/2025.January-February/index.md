## How was January 2025?

This is the first written article for January - February 2025. I decided to write a monthly curve of mine and put it on my blog to note what I have done in January 2025. This was the first month of the year! :)

>**Damn**: I totally forget to write february's monthly curve. So let merge January and February together.

### Side Project

As someone who always dives into new ideas, I started a new project. Like before, I also committed to many things. :)

### rs-college-deadline

This was a project I had been thinking about for a long time. It’s a Discord bot I made. The idea of this Discord bot is to summarize all my college assignments and send them to my Discord channel. I have been working on this project for a week.

### Idol Linux

As a long-time GNU/Linux user, I have been thinking about creating a new distro, and now I have started to create it. The name of this distro is Idol Linux.

The main goal of this distro is to create a system based on my Dotfiles that I use, featuring the Hyprland Dynamic Window Manager.

### CTF

This month, I joined the CTF competition, Bronco CTF 2025. Reflections can be found in my blog, which includes a write-up about Bronco CTF.

## College

I still hope some people are definitely interested in the same areas as I am, so I can pick them to be my friends!

More than that, I have been working on my college assignments and studying. I have to say this semester is really tough! Why do I have to learn so many useless things?

### Excel

I have no idea why my college is teaching Excel to manage projects. Wouldn't it be better to use Git or something else? So, I started learning to use Python to create Excel files (xlsx).

### Statistics

My college also has a statistics course, but why do we have to do it by hand? Just like with Excel, I’m using Python to handle statistics.

## Raspberry Pi Pico

I created a Rubber Ducky to play some cool stuff for automatically running programs. :o

### quickcv

My college launched an internship program, and I found a cool project called quickcv, which is a TypeScript-based CV maker. However, the project was inactive, so I forked it and continued working on it! :)

## LOL

Is that all? I almost forgot to write my monthly curve! I think there’s more I did this month. Actually, I just went through my GitHub to help me remember. It would be better to write things down regularly in real time about what I’ve done this month.
