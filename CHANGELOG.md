## 20250101

Finally

This is the first release of my article repository.

This release introduces a new approach to versioning all of my articles. The idea is to use a `YYYYMMDD` format for monthly tags and releases, which will help in tracking updates and changes more effectively.

With this system, I can utilize the release notes to document new articles, modifications, or updates to existing articles.

While semantic versioning (e.g., v0.2.0) is commonly used in software development to indicate major, minor, and patch changes, I believe this format is not the best fit for my articles. Therefore, adopting the `YYYYMMDD` approach provides a more suitable starting point for version control in this context.

As this is the first release, there are currently no changes :)
