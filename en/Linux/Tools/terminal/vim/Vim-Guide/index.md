## Introduction

vim is a powerful text editor that extends the functionality of Vim, providing an enhanced experience for text editing and coding. If you're new to vim or looking to master its capabilities, this guide will walk you through the fundamental modes, commands, and features.


## Understanding Modes

vim operates in different modes, each serving a specific purpose. Familiarizing yourself with these modes is essential for efficient text editing.

## Conclusion

As a Linux user, mastering a terminal-based text editor is essential. If you've become adept at Vim, you're a true Vim hackerâ€”whether it's Vi, Vim, or Neovim! :D

In terms of skills, not many people have mastered Linux, let alone Vim. Although there are text editors like Nano, they lack the robust features of Vim or Neovim, making them less powerful options.

Just like Windows Notepad and Notepad++, Notepad serves as the default text editor on Windows, but it's essentially a basic text editor. It lacks the comprehensive features to function like an integrated development environment (IDE).

So, I highly recommend learning Vi, Vim, Neovim, or Emacs as your daily file editor. Once you master them, you'll experience a significant change. Your computer skills will level up considerably.

Leave GUI programs aside and delve into terminal-based tools to elevate your computer skills and become proficient in the art of terminal hacking.
