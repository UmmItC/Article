## Introduction

In the previous article, I showed you how to physically install a hard disk in your computer. Now, in this article, I'll guide you through the process of automounting the hard disk on your Linux system, making it accessible and ready to use with just a few simple commands.

## Step 1: Switch to Root User

Since the operations require root permissions, switch to the root user without using `sudo`:

```shell
su
```

## Step 2: Create GPT Table and File System

Linux requires a GPT table for disks. Use `gdisk` to create the GPT table and format the file system. First, identify your disk name with `lsblk` or `blkid`.

```shell
gdisk /dev/sda
o
y
n
enter
enter
enter
enter
p (ensure the file system is correct)
w
y
```

## Step 3: Format the Disk and Choose File System Type

I prefer Btrfs for my disk type. Type:

```shell
mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda1
```

If you encounter an error indicating existing data, use the `-f` option to overwrite the `/dev/sda`.

```shell
mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sda1
```

## Step 4: Create Your Mount Source Path

Set a path for your files directory. Typically, mounting to the `/mnt/*` path is common.

```shell
mkdir /mnt/4tbhdd
```

## Step 5: Mounting the Disk

Mounting the disk can be done temporarily or set up for automount.

### Temporarily

For temporary mounting (until the system shutdown):

```shell
mount -t btrfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/4tbhdd/
```

### Auto-mount

1. Identify your file system UUID using `blkid`.

```shell
blkid /dev/sda1
```

2. Copy the UUID value and use your preferred text editor to add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:

```shell
‚ùØ nvim /etc/fstab

UUID=<uuid-of-btrfs-file-system>   /mnt/4tbhdd   btrfs   defaults  0   2
```

Explanation of the fields:

- `UUID=<uuid-of-btrfs-file-system>`: Replace the actual UUID of your Btrfs file system.
  
- `/mnt/4tbhdd`: This is the mount point where the Btrfs file system will be mounted. Ensure that the mount point exists before attempting to mount.

- `btrfs`: Specifies the file system type. In this case, it's Btrfs.

- `defaults`: This field includes default mount options. You can customize this field based on your specific needs, but `defaults` typically includes commonly used options.

- `0`: This field is used by `fsck` to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at boot time. A value of `0` means that the file system is not checked.

- `2`: This field is used by `dump` to determine the order in which filesystem backups are done at boot time. A value of `2` means that the file system is backed up.

After adding this entry to your `/etc/fstab` file, you can either reboot your system to apply the changes or manually mount the file system using the `mount -a` command.

### Verify the Mounting

A Simple way, back to your directory `/mnt/4tbhdd`, and you should see your hard disk has been mounted. Right-click the directory and verify the free space (`4.0 TB Free`).

## Step 6: Adjusting Permissions

After successfully auto-mounting the disk, you might notice that the ownership is restricted to the root user. This means you cannot use a regular user to create directories or manipulate files on the mounted disk. To address this, use the `chown` command to set permissions, allowing your user and group to access all items:

```shell
sudo chown user:group /mnt/4tbhdd
```

Replace `user` and `group` with your actual username and group. This adjustment ensures that you, as a regular user, have the necessary permissions to interact with the mounted disk.

## Conclusion

Automounting your hard disk on Linux ensures convenient access to your storage space without manual intervention. This process allows you to seamlessly integrate additional storage capacity into your system.
