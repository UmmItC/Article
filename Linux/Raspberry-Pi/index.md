## What is Raspberry Pi?

In essence, Raspberry Pi is a versatile and compact computer system that operates exclusively with select Linux distributions. While its size might be modest, its capabilities are far-reaching, making it a popular choice for a range of projects and applications.

## Raspberry Pi: Pros and Cons

1. **Compact Size:**
   - The standout feature is its diminutive size, making it a portable and space-efficient computing solution.

However, beyond its sleek design, Raspberry Pi models may not offer significant advantages, especially when considering the market prices and availability.

## Raspberry Pi Ports

Examining the Raspberry Pi Model B, it boasts various ports for connectivity:

- Micro HDMI Port x2
- Power Port x1
- Ethernet Port x1
- Headphone Port x1
- USB 2.0x2
- USB 3.0x2
- Micro SD Card Port x1

## Practical Use Cases

What can you accomplish with this compact computer? Raspberry Pi can function much like any standard computer, suitable for everyday tasks. However, it often finds its niche as a hosting platform, serving admirably as a modest server.
