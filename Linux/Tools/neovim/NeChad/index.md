## Overview

Neovim is a forked version of Vim, offering enhanced functionality and flexibility. A popular configuration for Neovim is NvChad, designed to streamline the installation and provide a feature-rich environment. This guide will walk you through the installation process and introduce key customization options.

## Installation

To install NvChad, use the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim
```

This command clones the repository into `~/.config/nvim` and launches Neovim. Upon loading, the prompt will ask, "Do you want to install example custom config? (y/n):" Type `n` since NvChad will handle the installation automatically.

>Note: Ensure a clean installation by removing any existing configurations:

```shell
rm -rfv ~/.local/share/nvim
```

## Theming

NvChad provides various themes. To access them, press `Space` + `t` + `h` in Neovim and choose from the available options.

## Syntax Highlighting

For language syntax highlighting, manually install supported languages. In Neovim, use:

```shell
TSInstall css html javascript
```

This example installs support for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Check installed syntax highlighting using:

```shell
TsInstallInfo
```

- Select file: Arrow keys
