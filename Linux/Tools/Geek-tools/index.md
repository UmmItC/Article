## Good-bye 2023 :o

Today is January 1, 2024, and this is the first post in 2024 that will be useful for end users.

As we all know, we hardly need Gui in our lives. everything the terminal can do.

First-class basic commands like ls, pwd, cd, lsblk, gdisk, fdisk, ps, pkill... I won't go into details here... I think you should be familiar with these tools.

BTW, this post just popped into my head on 2023-12-12 at around 11:55. As a useful article for 2024-01-01 :d. Now, Let's fire up the terminal geek tools :p
