# Introduction

Actually, Just past of the day, via my school, I knew there is a way to setup 2FA, then i started to learn how to set up. And now, i world like to share with you guys.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **A GNU/Linux server**: This guide will use Ubuntu as an example, but the steps should apply to most distributions.
- **A 2FA app**: Popular options include Google Authenticator, Authenticator, or Authy.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands is assumed.
- Do not use the root account for this setup. Using the root account might cause login issues after enabling 2FA.

## Step 1: Install the 2FA Package

To begin, you need to install the `libpam-google-authenticator` package on your server, which will enable 2FA functionality.

Run the following command to install it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
```

## Step 2: Configure the 2FA Package

Next, configure the Google Authenticator package by running:

```bash
google-authenticator
```

The system will prompt you with a few questions. You can generally respond with **'yes'** to each one.

Once completed, you'll see a **QR code** and a **secret key**. 

## Step 3: Scan the QR Code or Enter the Secret Key

Now, open your 2FA app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.), and either:

- **Scan the QR code** displayed on the terminal, or
- **Manually enter the secret key** if you can’t scan it.

Your app will start generating time-based 6-digit codes.

> **Tip:** If you’re using a different 2FA app, the process will be the same. Just make sure to enter the secret key manually if scanning the QR code isn't an option.

## Step 4: Configure SSH for 2FA

Next, you need to configure SSH to use 2FA. Edit the SSH daemon's configuration file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make sure these two lines are present (or add them if they aren't):

```bash
KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
```

These settings will enable keyboard-interactive authentication (which includes 2FA).

After saving the changes, close the file.

## Step 5: Restart SSH Service

To apply the changes, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

## Step 6: Configure PAM for 2FA

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) must also be configured to use Google Authenticator. Edit the PAM configuration for SSH:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/pam.d/sshd
```

Add the following line to the file:

```bash
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

Where you place this line in the file matters:

- **Above** the line containing `@include common-auth`: This will ask for your password first, followed by the 2FA code.
- **Below** `@include common-auth`: This will ask for the 2FA code first, followed by the password.

Choose the sequence you prefer, save the file, and exit.

## Step 7: Restart SSH Again

To ensure all changes take effect, restart the SSH service one more time:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

## Step 8: Test 2FA

It’s time to test the 2FA setup. Try SSHing into your server:

```bash
ssh your-username@your-server-ip -v
```

You should first be prompted for your password, and then for the 2FA verification code generated by your app. Example:

```bash
$ ssh user@your-server
Password:
Verification code:
```

If both the password and 2FA code are correct, you will be logged in.

And that's it! You've successfully set up 2FA on your GNU/Linux server.
