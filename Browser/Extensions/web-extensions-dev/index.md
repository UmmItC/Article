### [Wappalyzer](https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-TW/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/)

Wappalyzer is a powerful tool for identifying the technologies and frameworks used on a website. It aids developers in quickly understanding the technical components of a site.

>IMPORTANT: Wappalyzer seems to became paid service and no longer avilavble source code on GitHub. But you can still use the free version.

### [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-TW/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

Tampermonkey is a customizable user script manager that allows you to add custom JavaScript to web pages. It can be used to enhance the functionality of websites, automate tasks, and modify the appearance of pages.

>IMPORTANT: As my research, Tampermonkey is not open source, the lastest source code of Github that i found is only available to 2018. `Commits on Jun 5, 2018` So its to say that is closed source.
